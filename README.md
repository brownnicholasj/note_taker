# Note Taker Application

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green)

## Description

- The application will take user input from Command Line Input (CLI) to generate
  a HTML page with clickable links to email and github pages. This provides a
  quick access to these points of information for a team for optimal utilization
- The technology used for this application are: node, javascript, npm, npm
  inquirer, npm chalk, npm jest (dev only), fontawesome (html images)
- The biggest challenge I had was handling the requests for class extension,
  however once I got a bit of experience with what the program(s) expect, it
  became a lot clearer
