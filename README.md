# Note Taker Application

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green)

## Description

- This note taking application will allow a user to create and store notes with
  a title and body. The application stores the information in a database so
  information an be stored over a period of time, so the user can keep notes for
  a longer period of time.
- The technology used for this application are: node, javascript, express (npm),
  file structure (node), path (node) bootstrap styling, fontawesome (html
  images)
- The biggest challenge I had understanding how to handle static files within
  express. Once I found the required use, everything else seemed to work pretty
  easily.

### Behind the Code

- The GET request for /notes will return the user the notes.html and all other
  requests to the index.html <br> ![btc001](./public/assets/images/btc001.jpg)

- The GET and POST requests for api/notes will return the database and allow
  notes to be saved to the db: <br> ![btc002](./public/assets/images/btc002.jpg)

  ![btc003](./public/assets/images/btc003.jpg)

- The saver function within the code is called when a POST or DELETE request
  comes in and posts (or deletes) the data to the db.json file
  ![btc004](./public/assets/images/btc004.jpg)

- The unique identifier is determined by utilizing the date function within
  Javascript. This will establish a UNIX formatted date as the unique ID, since
  it inherently counts up with milliseconds, it will serve well as a unique ID
